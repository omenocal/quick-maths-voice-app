            "Welcome to Quick Maths! If you came here is because you want to test your speed on maths. I will tell you a math operation and you need to guess the right result. It's as simple as 1 + 1, you say 2, and you get points. So, here's the deal: if you guess the result in the first 3 seconds, you get 10 points. Between 4 and 6 seconds, you get 8 points. Between 7 and 9 seconds, you get 6 points. If you guess the result after 9 seconds, you get 2 points. Additionally, if your operation includes numbers from 10 to 100, your points are doubled, if it's up to 1000, they're multiplied by 3, and up to 10000, multiplied by 4. But, if you say a wrong answer, you will lose 1 point. If you have zero points and keep failing, your score remains in zero, so don't worry about that. So, should we get started?"

The 10 people with most points will be included in the leaderboard, available at any time for you when you subscribe to the competition. At the beginning of next month, you will see who's the genius in maths, your score will restart and you can participate again in the month.
